# Overview

The idea behind this exercise was to provide a weather analysis of Oahu, Hawaii using tools such as Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. Overall the goal was achieved, and some critical determinations could be made.

# Summary

According to the images, you can see that regardless of December or June, the temperature in Oahu is ideal at 71 and 75 degrees, and would make for a great investment. I also feel like apart from studying the wind temperature, ocean data should be collected to determine average tides, and also wind data to determine wind speed and wind chill. 

# Problems

As someone struggling to keep up with Modules, I did struggle with the switch from Windows to a MacOS however, I feel like the transition is now smooth, and I am picking up pace. Making Flask apps is a pretty powerful and interesting concept, and I look forward to applying that knowledge to my career
